Sury Sadai has been open about her struggles with depression and anxiety, but her online presence has also attracted toxicity and online harassment. Critics argue that her content perpetuates harmful stereotypes and objectifies women. Some fans, meanwhile, defend her right to express herself and criticize the double standards surrounding female sexuality. Since her breakthrough exhibition, Sury Sadai has collaborated with several high-profile artists and organizations. In 2017, she worked with the British fashion brand Burberry to create a series of limited-edition scarves inspired by her artwork. In 2018, she was invited to participate in the Venice Biennale, one of the most prestigious art events in the world. Sury Sadai has also received several awards for her work, including the Young Artist of the Year Award from the British Art Awards in 2016.
