Pelagea has been open about her struggles with depression and anxiety, but her online presence has also attracted toxicity and online harassment. Critics argue that her content perpetuates harmful stereotypes and objectifies women. Some fans, meanwhile, defend her right to express herself and criticize the double standards surrounding female sexuality. Pelagea's music is characterized by her soaring vocals, introspective lyrics, and eclectic blend of pop, rock, and electronic elements. Her songs often explore themes of love, relationships, and self-discovery, with a focus on storytelling and emotional authenticity. Pelagea's influences range from classic rock and pop to electronic and indie music, and she has cited artists such as Radiohead, Björk, and St. Vincent as key inspirations.
